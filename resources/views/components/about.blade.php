    <p class="lead">Hello!
        <strong>I'm Mert Hürtürk</strong>, a versatile software developer living in the scenic city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodrum" target="_blank">Bodrum</a>. My journey is sparked by creativity and a non-stop growth mindset, exploring software, music, art, and writing.
    </p>
    <p>I co-founded <a href="https://octeth.com" target="_blank">Octeth</a> and
        <a href="https://upcoach.com" target="_blank">upcoach</a>, embracing the roles of developer, designer, and tech lead. Though I started studying Visual Communication Design, I ventured into self-learning to broaden my horizons. I believe in continuous improvement, giving back, and empowering others. When I'm not coding, I love playing the guitar, drawing, or getting lost in thought, always on a quest for new inspiration and ways to grow.
