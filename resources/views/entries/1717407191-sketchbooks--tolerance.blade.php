    <h1>Tolerance</h1>
    <p>This sketchbook tracks my path to finding beauty in the "ugly." It was about learning to accept, even love, discomfort and flaws. I found that beauty often emerges because of the ugly, not just despite it. It all boiled down to embracing the ugly for beauty's sake.</p>
