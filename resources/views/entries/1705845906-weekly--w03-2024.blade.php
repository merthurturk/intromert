<h3>During the week</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Euthymia</i>, in Seneca’s words (from his essay on tranquility): “believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad footpaths of those wandering in every direction” &mdash; This word explains exactly how I feel lately.

    <li>"When goals are lighthouses, success is defined by simply showing up, by daily progress no matter how big or small.

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>Remaining steadfast in my focus, I consciously avoid glancing at the scoreboard or seeking validation from the judges during the "game". My sole commitment lies in giving my best performance, immersing myself completely in the game.</p>
