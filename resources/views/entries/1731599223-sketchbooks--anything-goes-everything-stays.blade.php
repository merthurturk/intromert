    <h1>Anything Goes, Everything Stays</h1>
    <p>This sketchbook started with a simple goal: to allow everything without judgment, creating a space where I could finally return to sketching after a break. As I filled its pages, I realized that this acceptance extended beyond the paper—it was about embracing myself. I learned to honor the gap between my skill and my taste, no longer measuring it as a flaw, but as a space where growth and creativity coexist. By the end, it wasn’t just a collection of sketches but a quiet acknowledgment of self-acceptance.</p>
