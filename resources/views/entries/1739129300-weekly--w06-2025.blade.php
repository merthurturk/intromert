<h3>Highlights</h3>

    <li>Back on track with my routines and momentum—feeling great!</li>
    <li>Built a small side-project for <a href="https://lovenotfear.com" target="_blank">Love Not Fear</a> in just one day and launching it this week.</li>
    <li>Shared end-of-day reports on <a href="https://x.com/merthurturk">@merthurturk</a> every day except Saturday, maintaining consistency by never skipping two days in a row.</li>
</ul>

<h3>During the week</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The hard reset continues, and I made great progress this week. I can already feel the energy and ideas flowing.</li>
    <li>I realized I’ve been neglecting my physical health lately. It’s time to accept where I am as my new baseline and start improving from here.</li>
    <li>Feeling energized and ready for the week ahead!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>This fresh surge of energy is my chance to prove to myself that I can do it again. After more than a year, I’m back and it’s time to push forward.</p>
