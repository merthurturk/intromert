<p class="lead">2024 Feb 12 - 18 &bullet; Year progress: 13%</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This week, I took a deep dive into upcoach's codebase, starting from scratch, as though I was completely new to the project. What was I aiming for? I wanted to spot where the friction points were and identify the weakest links in our developer experience. This approach was enlightening right off the bat, bringing to light areas that are screaming for improvement. And here's the thing â€“ this isn't just about coding. This idea of stepping back and seeing things with fresh eyes? It works everywhere. Signing up as a newbie to see what your onboarding feels like, or having your team explain their processes as if you're hearing it for the first time, can reveal so much. It's about gaining those crucial insights that we might overlook when we're too close to the project.</li>

        You aren't allowed to argue about supplements &amp; nutrition until you can do the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Deadlift your bodyweight for 10 reps</li>
            <li>Wall sit for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Dead hang for 1 minute</li>
            <li>Your VO2 max is in the 75th percentile (for your age and gender)</li>
        </ol>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>I'm experiencing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254162/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20state%20of,being%20as%20a%20learning%20process." target="_blank">euthymia</a>, feeling certain about my direction and moving full throttle towards it.</p>

    If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.
